# Real Estate Financial Advisor for First-Time Homebuyers in Hong Kong

## Introduction
Navigating the real estate market in Hong Kong, particularly for first-time property buyers, involves understanding a myriad of financial complexitiesâ€”from mortgages to legal and regulatory compliances. This project aims to simplify and guide young Hong Kong residents through the financial intricacies of buying their first home, helping users make informed decisions.

## Background Information
Hong Kong's property market is notorious for its high entry barriers, particularly the steep property prices which rank among the highest globally. This situation poses a substantial challenge for first-time homebuyers, who must navigate a labyrinth of financial and legal requirements. A first-time homebuyer in this context is defined as an individual applying for a mortgage without owning another residence in Hong Kong. Such individuals must consider several critical factors, including the Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio, which lenders use to assess an applicant's ability to manage monthly debt payments relative to their income. Additionally, potential buyers must undergo a stress test, which evaluates their capacity to maintain mortgage repayments under adverse economic scenarios, such as rising interest rates or declining income. These financial assessments are crucial in determining whether individuals can realistically afford to purchase and sustain ownership of a home in such a competitive market.
